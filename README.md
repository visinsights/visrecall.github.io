# Tell don’t just show: Narratives improve insight more thaninteractivity in communicative visualizations

### Introduction
These are the supplementary materials for the paper *Tell don’t just show: Narratives improve insight more thaninteractivity in communicative visualizations*, submitted to ACM CHI 2019. 


We provide the code to the visualizations that were shown to the participants to evaluate the effects of narrative and interactivity on insight. The visualizations were created using HTML, CSS and D3.js, and they require a local server to be set up. The index.html document provides links for easier access. In addition, we also provide the following files: questionnaires, the anonymous pre-registration document, and the files used for our data analyses (survey responses, logs, RMarkdown scripts etc.).
